# homebrew-dsp
A brew tap for tools that DSP uses that aren't ready for publishing to homebrew-core.

This could include:
* tools which are still unstable
* highly specific tools that aren't generally useful to the wider community
* tools that only work within the Broad infrastructure

You can add this tap to your brew installation with:
```
brew tap broadinstitute/dsp
```

Tools can then be installed as usual with brew.  ex:
```
brew install cromshell
```
